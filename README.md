# GraphRAG-SUM

Date 28/9/25


 Progress:

 
 Topic: GraphRAG-SUM: Graph-Augmented Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-News Summarization Combines graph-based document clustering with RAG pipelines to enhance factuality and     diversity in summary.

 
 Language: Python

 
 Libraries used: NLP processing, nltk/spacy

 
 Graph manipulation: network x

 
 LLM/Transformers: Hugging face transformers

 
 vector databases: FAISS/chromaDB

 
 step by step process for coding part:
 1. Data preprocessing
 2. Graph construction
 3. Clustering and retrival
 4. summarization model
 5. evaluation


 Use cases of this researcha and model:
 1. If any incident is occured and we have 50 articles on the topic this model evaluates  the 50 articles and give the summarization of the topic which saves the time.
 2. This model also combats misinformation.
 3. From the analysis point of view we can do like financial analysis and also customer feedback analysis.
 4. This model also helps in the scientific research purpose.
